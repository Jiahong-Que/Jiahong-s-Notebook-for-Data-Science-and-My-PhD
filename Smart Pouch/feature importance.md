Certainly! Here's a clear **English description** of the **types of features to be extracted from Smart Pouch sensor data**, along with the **reasoning behind each** â€” suitable for inclusion in reports, presentations, or meetings.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Types of Features to Extract and Why**

### 1. **Statistical Features (Descriptive)**

* **Examples**: Mean, Standard Deviation, Min, Max, Range
* **Purpose**: Capture the general behavior and variability of the signal over time. These are simple yet powerful features for identifying patterns across states (e.g., motion vs. idle).

---

### 2. **Signal Energy & Root Mean Square (RMS)**

* **Examples**:

  * RMS = âˆš(mean(xÂ²))
  * Energy = sum(xÂ²)
* **Purpose**: Reflect the intensity of motion or vibration. Higher energy indicates more active states like driving or lifting.

---

### 3. **Temporal Features**

* **Examples**:

  * Time duration of the window
  * Mean/variance of time differences (`delta_t`)
* **Purpose**: Ensure consistency in window segmentation and allow time-aware modeling (especially important if sampling is irregular).

---

### 4. **Frequency-Domain Features (optional for FFT-enhanced modeling)**

* **Examples**: Dominant frequency, spectral entropy, FFT peak amplitude
* **Purpose**: Identify hidden periodic patterns in movement or operation that are not obvious in the time domain (e.g., cyclic behavior during loading/unloading).

---

### 5. **Zero-Crossing Rate**

* **Definition**: Number of times the signal crosses zero within a window
* **Purpose**: Indicates vibration and oscillation behavior; useful for distinguishing mechanical vs. stationary phases.

---

### 6. **Axis-Specific and Cross-Axis Relations**

* **Examples**:

  * xAccel vs. yAccel covariance
  * gyroscope correlation across axes
* **Purpose**: Capture spatial dynamics and interaction between different motion directions. Often useful for differentiating behavior types or handling orientation.

---

### 7. **Statistical Moments (Advanced, optional)**

* **Examples**: Skewness, Kurtosis
* **Purpose**: Capture asymmetry and peakedness of signal distribution, useful for modeling rare or unusual behaviors.
