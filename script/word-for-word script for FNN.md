## ðŸŽ¥ **Full Script: How a Feedforward Neural Network Works (Mathematically)**

---

**\[Intro â€“ 0:00]**

"Hey everyone, welcome back to the channel! My name is \[Your Name], and today weâ€™re going to take a deep dive into how a feedforward neural network worksâ€”step by step, and most importantly, mathematically.

So if you've ever wondered what happens inside a neural network when it processes your data, you're in the right place. Grab a pen or open your notesâ€”letâ€™s break it all down."

---

**\[Section 1: What is a Feedforward Neural Network? â€“ 0:30]**

"A feedforward neural network, or FNN, is the most basic form of an artificial neural network.

Itâ€™s called feedforward because the data flows strictly in one directionâ€”forward. From the input layer, through the hidden layers, and finally to the output layer.

There are no loops, no cycles, no feedback. Each layer passes its result to the next.

Now letâ€™s look at how this works mathematically, layer by layer."

---

**\[Section 2: Network Structure and Notation â€“ 1:00]**

"Letâ€™s define the structure of a typical neural network.

Weâ€™ll say the network has capital L layers in total, including the output layer.

Weâ€™ll use lowercase l to index the layers, where l goes from 1 to L.

Layer zero, written as layer \[0], is the input layer.

Letâ€™s also define the number of neurons in each layer. Weâ€™ll say layer l has n sub l neurons. So nâ‚€ is the number of input features.

Each neuron in a layer receives inputs from all the neurons in the previous layer. And each connection has a weight.

Weâ€™ll define the weights going into layer l as a matrix W superscript l. That is:

$$
\mathbf{W}^{[l]}
$$

It has dimensions $n_l \times n_{l-1}$.

We also add a bias vector $\mathbf{b}^{[l]}$, which has dimension $n_l \times 1$.

Now weâ€™re ready to see how data flows through the network."

---

**\[Section 3: Forward Propagation Equations â€“ 2:10]**

"Suppose our input vector is $\mathbf{x}$, which is $n_0 \times 1$.

We set the activations of the input layer to be the input vector itself:

$$
\mathbf{a}^{[0]} = \mathbf{x}
$$

Now, for each layer l from 1 to L, we perform two steps: a linear transformation and a non-linear activation.

Step one: linear transformation. We calculate the weighted sum of the inputs:

$$
\mathbf{z}^{[l]} = \mathbf{W}^{[l]} \mathbf{a}^{[l-1]} + \mathbf{b}^{[l]}
$$

Step two: apply the activation function:

$$
\mathbf{a}^{[l]} = g^{[l]}(\mathbf{z}^{[l]})
$$

Where $g^{[l]}$ is some non-linear function, such as ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh.

So at each layer, weâ€™re just repeating this pattern:
Linear transformation â†’ non-linear activation â†’ output passed to the next layer."

**\[Section 4: Example Network â€“ 3:20]**

"Letâ€™s go through a simple example.

Imagine a neural network with:

* Two input features,
* One hidden layer with three neurons,
* And one output neuron.

Letâ€™s say our input vector is:

$$
\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{bmatrix}
$$

We define the weights for the first layer as:

$$
\mathbf{W}^{[1]} = \begin{bmatrix}
w_{11}^{[1]} & w_{12}^{[1]} \\
w_{21}^{[1]} & w_{22}^{[1]} \\
w_{31}^{[1]} & w_{32}^{[1]}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

And the bias vector:

$$
\mathbf{b}^{[1]} = \begin{bmatrix} b_1^{[1]} \\ b_2^{[1]} \\ b_3^{[1]} \end{bmatrix}
$$

Now we compute:

$$
\mathbf{z}^{[1]} = \mathbf{W}^{[1]} \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}^{[1]}
$$

Then we apply an activation function, letâ€™s say ReLU, defined as:

$$
\text{ReLU}(z) = \max(0, z)
$$

So we get:

$$
\mathbf{a}^{[1]} = \text{ReLU}(\mathbf{z}^{[1]})
$$

Next, for the output layer, we have weights $\mathbf{W}^{[2]}$ of shape $1 \times 3$, and bias $b^{[2]}$, a scalar.

We compute:

$$
z^{[2]} = \mathbf{W}^{[2]} \mathbf{a}^{[1]} + b^{[2]}
$$

Then apply the sigmoid function:

$$
\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
$$

So the final output is:

$$
\hat{y} = \sigma(z^{[2]})
$$

Thatâ€™s the prediction of our network."

**\[Section 5: Why Non-linear Activations â€“ 5:30]**

"You might be wondering, why do we apply non-linear activation functions?

Well, if we donâ€™t, then weâ€™re just stacking linear operations. And the composition of linear functions is still a linear function.

That means no matter how many layers we add, the network can only learn linear relationships.

Non-linear activationsâ€”like ReLU, sigmoid, or tanhâ€”are what give the network the ability to model complex patterns."

---

**\[Section 6: Dimension Check â€“ 6:20]**

"Letâ€™s quickly verify dimensions to make sure everything fits.

* If input $\mathbf{x}$ is shape $2 \times 1$,
* And $\mathbf{W}^{[1]}$ is $3 \times 2$,
* Then $\mathbf{W}^{[1]} \mathbf{x}$ is $3 \times 1$,
* Add bias $\mathbf{b}^{[1]}$, also $3 \times 1$, gives us $\mathbf{z}^{[1]}$, shape $3 \times 1$.

That goes into the next layer.

* $\mathbf{W}^{[2]}$ is $1 \times 3$,
* $\mathbf{a}^{[1]}$ is $3 \times 1$,
* So the product is $1 \times 1$,
* Add scalar bias $b^{[2]}$, and output is scalar.

Perfect."

**\[Section 7: Output Types and Loss Functions â€“ 7:30]**

"The last layer of the network depends on your task:

* For regression, we usually use a linear output and minimize **mean squared error**.
* For binary classification, we use a sigmoid activation and **binary cross-entropy** loss:

$$
L = -\left[y \log(\hat{y}) + (1 - y)\log(1 - \hat{y})\right]
$$

* For multi-class classification, we use a **softmax** output and **categorical cross-entropy**."

**\[Conclusion â€“ 8:30]**

"So there you have it. Thatâ€™s how a feedforward neural network worksâ€”mathematically.

Weâ€™ve gone through the structure, the equations, a numerical example, and even touched on activation functions and output layers.

In the next video, weâ€™ll cover **how to train** the network using **backpropagation** and **gradient descent**, where we actually update the weights to make the network learn.
